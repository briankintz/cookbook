Roughly chop the onion, scallions and chilies, then grate the ginger and garlic and add them all to a food processor. Add the liquids and spices and blend until fairly smooth.

Cover chicken and let sit for at least 2 hours before grilling. Optionally set aside some marinade for brushing onto the meat during grilling.

Makes enough marinade for about 500g-1kg (1-2lbs) of chicken depending on if you save some for using while grilling.
