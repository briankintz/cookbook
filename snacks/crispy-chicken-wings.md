:dart:Easy  ·:clock4:45 Minutes  ·:flag\_us:American

### Ingredients

* 500g chicken wings
* 1 Tbsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 1/4 tsp. smoked paprika

### Directions

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil to catch the fat and place a lightly greased wire rack on top of it.

If necessary, separate the chicken wings into drumlettes and flats using a sharp knife or kitchen scissors.

Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl, then add the chicken wings and toss until coated.

Place the wings onto the baking rack and bake in a preheated oven at 220°C / 425°F for about 30-40 minutes until golden brown and crispy, flipping halfway through.

After baking, toss the wings lightly in the sauce of your choice (buffalo, barbeque, ...) and serve with a dip (ranch, blue cheese, honey mustard, ...)
