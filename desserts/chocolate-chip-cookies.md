# Chocolate Chip Cookies

### Ingredients

* 725g all purpose flour (type 405)
* 1 1/2 tsp (\~11g) salt
* 1 1/2 tsp (\~10g) baking soda
* 3/4 tsp (\~5g) baking powder
* 500g unsalted butter
* 1-2 Tbsp coconut oil (optional)
* 370g white sugar
* 320g light brown sugar/muscovado
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 4 eggs
* \~600g chocolate (chips or chopped into chunks)

### Directions

Melt \~â…” of the butter in a pan and simmer until it starts to turn golden brown, then remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.

While the butter is cooling, combine flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder in a bowl and set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine browned + softened butter, coconut oil, sugar, brown sugar and vanilla and beat until creamy, then add the eggs and beat again until creamy.

Slowly add the flour mixture, mixing until all the flour is added and a dough is formed. Mix in the chocolate.

Refrigerate overnight before baking (optional, but highly recommended).

Preheat oven to 350F / 180C convection.

Form the dough into balls and place evenly spaced on a baking tray, keeping cold until they go into the oven.

Bake for 5 minutes, then rotate the tray and bake for another 4-5 minutes before removing from the oven. Allow the cookies to cool for 1-2 minutes before moving to a wire rack with a layer of paper towels on top to cool completely.

Makes approximately 1 small mountain of cookies.

Tip - bake half, freeze half! To freeze, form the cookie dough balls normally, then place them a plate or sheet tray and freeze.  Once they're completely frozen, move to a freezer bag for storage.

Frozen cookie dough balls don't need to thaw before baking - just lower the temp to 325F / 160C and bake for a couple minutes longer.
