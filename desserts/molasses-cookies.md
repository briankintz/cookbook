Don't use a stand mixer! The mixed dough is **very** firm and sticky!
{% endhint %}

Refrigerate overnight before baking.

Preheat oven to 375F / 190C convection.

Form the dough into balls and roll in sugar to coat. Place evenly spaced on a baking tray, keeping cold until they go into the oven.

Bake for 5 minutes, then rotate the tray and bake for another 4 minutes before removing from the oven. Allow the cookies to cool for 1 minute before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
