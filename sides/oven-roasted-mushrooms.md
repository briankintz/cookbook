# Oven Roasted Mushrooms

:dart: Easy  · :clock4: 15-30 Minutes  · :four\_leaf\_clover: Vegetarian

### Ingredients

You can use any kind of mushrooms you want, but because we're seasoning them the standard button mushrooms / champignons work just fine.

For the seasoning, the measurements are per "double handful" of thinly sliced mushrooms, so adjust accordingly:

* [ ] 1/2 Tbsp. olive oil
* [ ] 1/2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
* [ ] 1/2 Tbsp. bourbon
* [ ] 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
* [ ] 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika
* [ ] 1 small clove garlic

### Directions

Clean the mushrooms (either rinse lightly or brush dirt off with a bunched up paper towel).

Shorten the stems and slice as thinly as possible. If you find this hard, check out the video below to _sharpen up_ your knife skills.

Peel the garlic clove and crush it with the flat of the knife. Either slice the crushed garlic _extremely_ thinly or just finely chop it.

Add the liquids, spices and garlic to a large mixing bowl and stir together. Add the sliced mushrooms and toss to coat.

Spread the mushrooms evenly on a parchment lined baking tray or sheet pan and place in a preheated oven at 180°C / 375°F on convection. Don't add too many mushrooms at once...they will shrink during roasting, but the more spread out they are they better.

Mushrooms container a ton of water that needs to evaporate, so open the oven door briefly every 5-10 minutes to let steam out ( :warning: don't be like me and eagerly try to look into the oven as you let the steam out...it's hot :hotsprings: ). Once the mushrooms look slightly browned and dried on the top (after about 10 minutes), stir them around to make sure both sides get roasted.

Once the mushrooms are browned and dried out, remove them from the oven either eat them directly or let them cool before storing in the fridge in an airtight container.

### Variations

Don't like bourbon? Just leave it out - or swap in red wine, a splash of apple cider vinegar, balsamico or whatever else you think might taste good!
