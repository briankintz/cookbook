:dart: Easy  · :clock4: 3 Hours  · :french\_bread: Bread

### Ingredients

* 1 packet dry yeast
* 500g bread flour&#x20;
* 315g luke warm water
* 4 tsp. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
* 2 Tbsp. olive oil

### Directions

Dissolve 1 tsp. sugar in about a third of the water, then sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it stand for about 10 minutes until the yeast activates and becomes foamy.

Combine flour, salt and remaining 3 tsp. sugar in a large bowl. Once the yeast mixture is ready, add that along with the remaining water and mix on low with a stand mixer for a few minutes, then add the olive oil and keep mixing until the oil is completely worked into the dough.

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for a few minutes, stretching and folding the dough over onto itself until it's smooth but still slightly sticky.

Coat the inside of a large bowl lightly with olive oil, then form the dough into a ball and place the dough inside and cover with plastic wrap. Put the bowl in a warm place (in the sun or in the oven with the light on) and let it sit until it's doubled in size (at least an hour).

Turn the dough back out on to a lightly floured surface, then gently knead the dough into a ball and cut into 4-6 equal pieces. Gently form the pieces into a roll about 12cm / 5" long and place on a baking paper lined baking tray.

Brush some olive oil on the rolls, then cover lightly with plastic wrap and place back in a warm place until the rolls have almost doubled in size again.

Remove the plastic wrap and bake in a fully preheated oven at 220C / 425F for 10 minutes then reduce the temperature to 200C / 400F for another \~15 minutes until the crust is golden brown.

Cool on a wire rack and make a sandwich!

### Variations
