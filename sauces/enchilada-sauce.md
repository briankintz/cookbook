:dart:Easy  ·:clock4:15 Minutes  · :flag\_mx: Mexican

### Ingredients

* 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
* 3 Tbsp. flour
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* 1 tsp. chili powder
* 1 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp. smoked paprika
* 1 tsp. garlic powder
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
* 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
* Salt
* 2 Tbsp. tomato paste
* 500ml vegetable broth
* 1 splash apple cider vinegar

### Directions

Mix the flour and spices together in a small bowl and make sure the tomato paste and vegetable broth are ready to go, then melt the butter in a sauce pan over medium heat. Once the butter is hot and has stopped spitting, add the flour/spice mixture and whisk constantly for about a minute until the spices are fragrant and slightly darker. Add the tomato paste and keep whisking until it's heated up.

Add about a quarter of the broth at a time, whisking constantly and waiting each time for the consistency to even out before adding more broth. Once the sauce has reached a suitably saucy texture, remove from heat and whisk in the vinegar.

Give it a taste and adjust the spices as desired. Depending on how salty your vegetable broth is you may need to add a healthy pinch of salt.

### Variants

* To make it a bit richer and creamier, substitute whole milk for half of the vegetable broth.
