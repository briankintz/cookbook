:dart: Easy · :clock4: 30 Minutes · :flag\_mx: Mexican

### Ingredients

#### Part 1

* 1-2 dried Ancho chilis
* 2-3 dried Chipotle chilis
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1 bay leaf
* 4-5 whole cloves

#### Part 2

* 4 garlic cloves
* 1 Tbsp. molasses
* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* Juice from 2 oranges
* Juice from 2 limes

### Directions

Add all ingredients from part 1 to a sauce pan and add enough water to cover the chilis. Simmer until the chilis are completely rehydrated (about 15-20mins).

Remove chili stems, bay leaf, cinnamon stick and cloves, then add the chilis and all the liquid to a blender or food processor, along with all of the part 2 ingredients.

Blend until smooth, then press the resulting sauce through a fine mesh sieve to remove any remaining solids (aka chili seeds).

Season to taste with salt and/or a splash of dark soy sauce.

### Variants

* Increase or reduce the number of Chipotles to adjust the heat
